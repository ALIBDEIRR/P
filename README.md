This code was starting training code for me using tkinter library.
THE INTERFCAE WAS BUILT TO CONTROL THE MOVEMENT OF AN ARDUINO BASED ROBOT.

The code above include just graphical feature like on/off lighting  and timer , The control part of the robot is not implemented in the code above .

This code can be reallly helpfull for students or any one who want to have a brief idea about tkinter library features in python and how can they use it for many application.
